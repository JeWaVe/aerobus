There are several ways to contribute to Aerobus, and all are equally welcomed. 

Whatever the reason, please follow our Code of Conduct. 

# No code

## Raise a bug

Raising bug is crucial when it comes to contributing to software development, particularly in open source world. 
When you have questions, encounter issues, see discrepancies in API or behavior, please take the time to open an issue. 

## Propose features or enhancements

If you think about something of interest that aerobus can help solve, or something it should integrate, please open an issue and tag it "enhancement". 

# Code

For all that follows : 

- implementations must have an associated issue
- develop in dedicated branch, labelled with issue ID and name, for example : "bug-41-undefined-behavior-with-intel-compiler" or "feature-28-compensated-horner". 
- write **clean code** (explicit names, short functions, no deep nesting, ...)
- comment and document your code
- do not hesitate to engage discussions with others
- test your code
- rebase your branch on main
- propose pull request with detailed explanations of what's going on

## Fix bugs

Fixing bugs is one of the best ways to get onboarded on complex code bases. As every project on earth, aerobus warmly welcome bug fixes.

## Write tests

Unit testing is a never-finished task. The more tests, the more stable the code. Tests are always welcomed.

## Implement features

Before starting development, please engage discussion in an issue and open it if it's not already.
