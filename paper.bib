	abstract="In order to achieve optimal performance on multi-core and multi-processor systems, we need to fully use the features of parallelism and manage the memory hierarchical characters efficiently. The performance of sequential codes relies on the instruction-level and register-level SIMD parallelism, and also on high-speed cache-blocking functions. Threading applications need advanced planning to achieve satisfactory load balancing.",
